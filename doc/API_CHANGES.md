After reviewing our teams DESIGN.md file, I have concluded that we implemented all four of the API's 
that we set out to use in the project: Compiler, Command Prompt, Turtle, and Controller. 

The two clear deviations from the plan:

1) We did not implement a turtle map object to handle multiple turtles 

- We handled multiple turtles in memory instead

2) We did not implement ProgramHandle.java, TurtleHandle.java, MathHandle.java, and StateHandle.java 

- To make the implementation easier and better designed, we created a class for each command rather
than having one class that handles all of one similar command.
